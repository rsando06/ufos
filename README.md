# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a webpage that displays information on UFO sightings based on the user's input based on multiple criteria.

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: Python 3.10, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

## Deployed Webpage
https://rsando06.github.io/ufos/

## Challenge Summary
- The one drawback to this challenge is that it is unknown what criteria can be used as input.
- One additional recommendation would be to add a refresh button on the table instead of having to reload the entire webpage.
- Another additional recommendation would be to use drop-down filters with the possible criteria a user can choose from.
